# Analyzing the impacts of Power Outages caused by Natural Disasters across different regions in the US
## Project Overview
This is a data science project on if power outages are more likely to effect costal states more than inward states.

## Introduction

Welcome to our exploration of how severe weather affects power outages in the United States. Our analysis dives into a comprehensive dataset to uncover patterns between whether the location of a state matters in comparison to the amount of power outages they get. For example do coastal states tend to experience more power outages then states that are inland.

## Project Overview:
This project investigates [Why do some states that have power outages caused by Severe Weather have more power outages than others?], utilizing data from [Outage]. The dataset consists of [1534] records and includes key columns such as:

|Column	                 |Description|
|---                     |---        |
|`'Year'	`            |The year the outage occured|
|`'Month'`	                 |The month of the year the outage occurred |
|`'U.S._State'`	         |The state our outage occurred in|
|`'Climate.Region'`	     |The region of the US that this state is in|
|`'Anomaly.level'`	            |How much of an anomaly this power outage was |
|`'Outage.Duration'`	              |How long the outage lasted|

## ADD MORE HERE IF YOU THINK WE NEED MORE

Why This Matters: If you want to get a new home somewhere but want to have reliable power this could be useful. Company wise if companies wanted to put their focus more towards those areas that get outages more often to help they could also check and be able to help.
